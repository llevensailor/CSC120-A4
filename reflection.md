- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
    Encapsulation affects the way we can use differnet information in programming. It affected how I accessed different information, if I needed to add an accessor method or if I could just access the data from a different class. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would advise them to work with the read me tab closly and follow it to a t. I am not completely sure if I did everything correctly or was able to get everything I needed but I followed the steps closly and that got me very far. They are very detailed and told me exactly what I needed to do.
